 * Note: This plugin will become operational only after it was compiled and associated with the current world (.wbt).
 * To associate this plugin with the world follow these steps:
 *  1. In the Scene Tree, expand the "WorldInfo" node and select its "physics" field
 *  2. Then hit the [Select] button at the bottom of the Scene Tree
 *  3. In the list choose the name of this plugin (same as this file without the extention)
 *  4. Then save the .wbt by hitting the "Save" button in the toolbar of the 3D view
 *  5. Then revert the simulation: the plugin should now load and execute with the current simulation
