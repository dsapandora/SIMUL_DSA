All the joint states\n# in one message have to be recorded at the same time.\n#\n# This message consists of a multiple arrays, one for each part of the joint state. \n# The goal is to make each of the fields optional. When e.g. your joints have no\n# effort associated with them, you can leave the effort array empty. \n#\n# All arrays in this message should have the same size, or be empty.\n# This is the only way to uniquely associate the joint name with the correct\n# states.\n\n\nHeader header\n\nstring[] name\nfloat64[] position\nfloat64[] velocity\nfloat64[] effort\n";
