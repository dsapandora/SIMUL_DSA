This folder contains the HID report descriptors for various logitech wheels.
They were converted using the hidrd-convert tool (http://digimend.sourceforge.net/#proj-hidrd)

How to obtain the descriptors:

1. mount debug fs:
   mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug

2. obtain report descriptor
   cat /sys/kernel/debug/hid/<device>/rdesc

3. take the first line which is the hex representation of the descriptor
   cat /sys/kernel/debug/hid/<device>/rdesc | head -n1

4. convert the hex into real binary
   cat /sys/kernel/debug/hid/<device>/rdesc | head -n1 | xxd -r -p

5. pipe the binary into hidrd-convert and ask for xml output
   cat /sys/kernel/debug/hid/<device>/rdesc | head -n1 | xxd -r -p | hidrd-convert -i natv -o xml


Note: The descriptor "rdesc_DFP_native.xml" is not the original one provided by the hardware - It
has been patched in the hid-logitech driver to report separate brake/gas axes instead of just a
combined value.
