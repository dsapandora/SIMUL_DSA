===================================================================================

This project is not maintained anymore. We managed to get most / all wheels supported directly by
the kernel, so there is no need for this separate tool anymore.

Thank you to all involved hackers :-)

This tool allows you to change various settings of the Logitech racing wheels
-> Driving Force
-> Momo Racing
-> Momo Force
-> Driving Force Pro
-> Driving Force GT
-> G25
-> G27

Available options:
-> set wheel to "native" mode (support separate axes and clutch pedal, H shifter, full 900 degree rotation)
-> Set wheel rotation range
-> Set autocenter force and rampspeed
-> Set ForceFeedback gain
