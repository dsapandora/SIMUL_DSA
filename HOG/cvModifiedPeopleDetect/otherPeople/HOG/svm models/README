This parameters are for the "no overlap" model. If you want to use this model, application parameters must be the following:

window_width=64
window_height=128
bins = 9
cell_size = 8
block_size = 2
signed = false
voter = magnitudevoter
norm = L2Norm
overlap = 0

This parameters are for the "with overlap" model. If you want to use this model, application parameters must be the following:

window_height=128
bins = 9
cell_size = 8
block_size = 2
signed = false
voter = magnitudevoter
norm = L2Norm
overlap = 1
