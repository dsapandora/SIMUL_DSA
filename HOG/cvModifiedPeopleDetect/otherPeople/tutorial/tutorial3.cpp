/*This function takes in a the path and names of 64x128 pixel images, the size of the cell to be
used for calculation of hog features(which should be 8x8 pixels, some modifications will have to be 
done in the code for a different cell size, which could be easily done once the reader understands
how the code works), a default block size of 2x2 cells has been considered and the window size
parameter should be 64x128 pixels (appropriate modifications can be easily done for other say
64x80 pixel window size). All the training images are expected to be stored at the same location and
the names of all the images are expected to be in sequential order like a1.jpg, a2.jpg, a3.jpg ..
and so on or a(1).jpg, a(2).jpg, a(3).jpg ... The explanation of all the parameters below will make
clear the usage of the function. The synopsis of the function is as follows :

prefix : it should be the path of the images, along with the prefix in the image name for
example if the present working directory is /home/saurabh/hog/ and the images are in
/home/saurabh/hog/images/positive/ and are named like pos1.jpg, pos2.jpg, pos3.jpg ....,
then the prefix parameter would be "images/positive/pos" or if the images are
named like pos(1).jpg, pos(2).jpg, pos(3).jpg ... instead, the prefix parameter
would be "images/positive/pos("suffix : it is the part of the name of the image
files after the number for example for the above examples it would be ".jpg" or ").jpg"

cell   : it should be CvSize(8,8), appropriate changes need to be made for other cell sizes
window : it should be CvSize(64,128), appropriate changes need to be made for other window sizes
number_samples : it should be equal to the number of training images, for example if the
training images are pos1.jpg, pos2.jpg ..... pos1216.jpg, then it should be 1216

start_index : it should be the start index of the images' names for example for the above case it
should be 1 or if the images were named like pos1000.jpg, pos1001.jpg, pos1002.jpg
.... pos2216.jpg, then it should be 1000 

end_index : it should be the end index of the images' name for example for the above cases it should be 1216 or 2216 
savexml   : if you want to store the extracted features, then you can pass to it the name of an xml
file to which they should be saved

normalization : the normalization scheme to be used for computing the hog features, any of the
opencv schemes could be passed or -1 could be passed if no normalization is to be done

/* This function is almost the same as train_64x128(...), except the fact that it can
take as input images of bigger sizes and generate multiple samples out of a single
image.

It takes 2 more parameters than train_64x128(...), horizontal_scans and
vertical_scans to determine how many samples are to be generated from the image. It
generates horizontal_scans x vertical_scans number of samples. The meaning of rest of the
parameters is same.

For example for a window size of 64x128 pixels, if a 320x240 pixel image is
given input with horizontal_scans = 5 and vertical scans = 2, then it will generate to
samples by considering windows in the image with (x,y,width,height) as 
(0,0,64,128),
(64,0,64,128), (128,0,64,128), ....., 
(0,112,64,128), (64,112,64,128) .....
(256,112,64,128)

The function takes non-overlapping windows from the image except the last row and last
column, which could overlap with the second last row or second last column. So the values
of horizontal_scans and vertical_scans passed should be such that it is possible to perform
that many scans in a non-overlapping fashion on the given image. For example horizontal_scans
= 5 and vertical_scans = 3 cannot be passed for a 320x240 pixel image as that many vertical scans
are not possible for an image of height 240 pixels and window of height 128 pixels.
