From hogCompute3, we did successfully trained the HOG detector. Now we want to do Hard training. According to todo in 3.

Hi, 

The method can be summarized as below: 

        1. you should collect several images that do not contain any positive sample 
(e.g. 1000 images). 
        2. randomly crop some windows (e.g 10 window per image) from negative samples 
and re-size them to your HOG search window (e.g. 64x128). 
        3. use them as negatives to train your system. 
        4. After you build the training vector, loop it around all of your preliminary 
negative images (first 1000 images). 
        5. obviously, any detected windows is false alarm. so use them in addition to 
previous randomly selected windows to retrain your detector. this can 
dramatically boost your detector's performance. but do not repeat it for second 
time, because for the second time, the improvement will be negligible.good luck, 

Ehsan
