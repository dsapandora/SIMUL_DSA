Opencv 2.1 implements the people detection using Dalal HOG algorithm with a default descriptor. However, the method to train the hog descriptor is not provided. I had my time figure out how this can be done. However, I think for the future, other people may not need to invest time reinventing this again. Also, I welcome the improvement/discussion. Please contribute the project by trying/discussing about it.
